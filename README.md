DETECTING DNS OVER HTTPS (DOH) TRAFFIC USING MACHINE LEARNING
 

Problem: 
DNS over HTTPS (DoH) hides DNS requests in encrypted traffic, making detection harder.


Objective:
Build machine learning models to classify DoH and Non-DoH traffic.


Why it Matters:
Prevent misuse of DoH for malicious activities and enhance network securityc.
